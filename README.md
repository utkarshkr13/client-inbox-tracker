# Client Inbox Tracker — L2 Client Escalation Portal

> A production-grade client communication management system for Business Analysts and L2 support teams, featuring intelligent Gmail-based routing, SLA enforcement, and a full escalation workflow.

🔗 **Live app**: https://client-inbox-tracker.vercel.app

## What It Does

Client-facing teams often manage dozens of client emails across multiple projects with no structured way to track SLAs, route to the right person, or escalate when things fall through. This tool solves exactly that.

It connects to your Gmail account, syncs client emails per project, and gives the BA and L2 team a shared dashboard to triage, respond, escalate, and report — all without ever leaving the app.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart L2 / BA Routing
Automatically determines the correct responder based on Gmail To/CC fields:

| Gmail Signal | Routing Decision |
|---|---|
| Email **To: BA**, L2 in CC | → BA tier — BA leads, L2 looped in |
| Email **To: L2**, BA in CC | → L2 tier — L2 must respond first |
| Email **To: BA and L2** | → BA tier — BA explicitly addressed |
| No match | → Category-based fallback (Bug/General → L2) |

### 2. SLA Tracker
- Configurable SLA thresholds per project
- Amber warning badge as deadline approaches
- Red breach badge when SLA is exceeded
- Dedicated **L2 SLA breach** alerts: `"🔴 L2 SLA breach — BA to step in"`
- Weekly Digest surfaces all overdue L2 emails with hours overdue

### 3. Escalation Workflow
- One-click escalation with required note
- Status set to `"escalated"` — visible across the team
- BA's Weekly Digest shows the full escalation queue

### 4. Internal Notes
- Private notes per email thread — never touches Gmail
- Full note history retained

### 5. Full-Text Search
- Cross-project search across subject, sender, snippet, and email content

### 6. Analytics Dashboard
- Charts for: status distribution, category breakdown, routing split (L2 vs BA), project volume
- Weekly Digest KPI strip with escalation count, follow-up due count, L2 SLA breach count

### 7. AI Auto-Categorisation
- On every sync, emails are automatically tagged: Billing / Bug / Feature / Meeting / Approval / Update / General
- Keyword-based classification — no external API call needed

### 8. Client CRM (Lite)
- Per-project contact profiles: name, role, company, contract end date, risk level (RAG)

### 9. Mobile PWA
- Installable on iPhone and Android via `manifest.json` and Apple web app meta tags

### 10. Additional Features
- **Custom Tags** — colour-coded, apply/remove per email
- **Follow-up Reminders** — date picker with overdue badge in Digest
- **Bulk Actions** — multi-select → Done / Dismiss / Pending / Route to L2 / Route to BA
- **Thread View** — group emails by Gmail thread ID
- **Attachment Indicator** — 📎 badge auto-detected on sync
- **Audit Trail** — full activity log per email with timestamp
- **Response Templates** — CRUD library with clipboard copy from email view
- **Webhook / Slack Notifications** — fire on status changes, configurable per project
- **Project Templates** — save SLA config and reuse across new projects

> **Note:** A Google Cloud project with Gmail API and Google OAuth credentials is required. See `.env.example` for all required environment variables — no keys are hardcoded in this repo.

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the full list. Required keys:

```
DATABASE_URL=          # Neon Postgres connection string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=       # Random secret for NextAuth sessions
NEXTAUTH_URL=          # Your app URL (http://localhost:3000 for dev)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=      # Google OAuth client ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=  # Google OAuth client secret
```

## Routing Logic (How Smart Routing Works)

On every Gmail sync, each email's `To` and `CC` headers are checked against the project's configured BA and L2 email addresses:

```
if (toAddresses.includes(l2Email) && !toAddresses.includes(baEmail)):
  routingTier = "L2"
elif (toAddresses.includes(baEmail)):
  routingTier = "BA"
else:
  routingTier = category-based fallback
```

This is re-evaluated on every sync, so routing stays accurate even as threads evolve.

## Project Status

Active and deployed. Built as a BA productivity tool for managing multi-project client communication at scale.
